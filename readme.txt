Every key press, every scroll and click is recorded and played back in real time.  The most important aspect of this is the Metadata.  Vantage point uses MaxMind Geo IP digital fingerprinting to help build solid video evidence. Free service allows up to 25,000 recordings a month including free Maxmind Geo IP data.

Should your customer or payment provider question an order, simply sharing the digital video evidence stops them from pursuing any kind of chargeback. 

Payment provider independent, share the video evidence with PayPal, Worldpay, Skrill, Amazon Payments in fact any payment provider and off course your customers.

Vantage Point builds solid realtime video evidence to defend your woo commerce store against friendly fraud chargebacks.  

Free service includes:

- 25,000 order recordings a month
- Free MaxMind Geo IP and device fingerprinting
- Unlimited Viewing
- Unlimited Sharing
- Free forever 




= Free Forever Explained =


We are based on a freemium business model, the business is designed to have 98% of its clients using the free service.  The free service included is large enough for most online shops, however some clients may wish to extend the video count above 25,000 per month and keep the videos active for up to 90 days or even longer for this we charge an upgrade fee. 


We hope that our free service will go a long way in combating friendly fraud.  Friendly fraud is increasing at alarming rates.  We believe a solution is needed for all online merchants, not just the paying few. 


Free users are NOT required to subscribe to MaxMind's service, we are the scubscriber and hold the API Key for all Geo IP lookups.




= Scalability and Speed =


Vantage point does not affect the performance of your website in anyway.  The video recordings are produced offline on the vantage point servers.  We host a number of servers using a mix of cloud Services, Dedicated Servers, Block storage, and multiple locations and much more allowing us to handle high volume websites.

The service comes complete with a free subscription.  This is a hosted service. Meaning all the leg work of building video recordings is performed on Vantage Point servers and you can access them anytime via a dedicated dashboard in your wordpress admin panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Is this really a free service? =

Yes, We are based on a freemium business model, the business is designed to have 98% of its clients using the free service.  The free service included is large enough for most online shops, however some clients may wish to extend the video count above 25,000 per month and keep the videos active for up to 90 days or even longer, for this we charge an upgrade fee. 




= What are differences between an upgraded account and a free account? =

The only difference is the number of recordings per month will be increased and the storage of videos can be increased up to 90 days. 




= Do I need to have a MaxMind account? =

No, the MaxMind Geo IP service is provided to you by Vantage Point we are the subscriber and we pay the fees for all IP lookups and Geo Location checks.  You do not need any subscription to Maxmind.




= How easy is it to get Vantage point up and running on my site? =
 
Installing the plugin will insert the recording snippet into your woocommerce website.  This will take care of all the installation process and user tracking.




= How are Visitors calculated in Vantage point? =

Our software is smart enough to filter out the recordings and save only the ones that contain actual orders.   We count this as one recording, so even if your website has a hundred visitors and four people place orders we only count four recordings.
 



= How many videos can I share? =

There is no limitation on sharing. 




= Can the video be modified after it has been created? =

No, the video cannot be modified. It records the actual screens and mouse movements key presses etc. This cannot be altered in anyway. 




= How long to do you keep the video recordings for? =

We keep the videos for 90 days, this is just in case a customer makes a chargeback claim weeks after the order.   




= I send an order confirmation after each sale. Do I still need video evidence? =


Sending an order confirmation after the sale is normal practice the issue is that it happens after the sale and offers no real defence.  Vantage Point video evidence recordings offer the power, comfort and peace of mind of having what legal professionals describe as:



'A true real time record of events, leading to and including the transaction between all parties' 




= What happens to the videos when I cancel my account? =

The videos will be marked for deletion which runs every 48 hours. We leave a two day window in case you decide to reactivate your account.
